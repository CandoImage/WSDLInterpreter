WSDLInterpreter
===============

The WSDLInterpreter package is used for the interpretation of a WSDL document into PHP classes that represent the messages using inheritance and typing as defined by the WSDL rather than SoapClient's limited interpretation.  PHP classes are also created for each service that represent the methods with any appropriate overloading and strict variable type checking as defined by the WSDL.
